# Computer_Vision_Algorithms_Implementation

This project is on halt indefinitely.
In the old times, people who could design the filters were really considered masters of the Computer Vision (CV) domain
It was started when I was naively excited about the Computer Vision and wanted unveil the "magic" of how it works by writing code for all the famous CV filters
But as Deep Learning took a giant leap, it becomes more and more irrelevant to write filters manually. Having said that, deep learning has not yet replaced the old CV techniques, but the field is advancing at such a pace that doing this hobby project is not on anywhere near the "priority queue" at this point in time
